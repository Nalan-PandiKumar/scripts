# Scripts

Welcome to the **Scripts** directory! This folder contains various automation software tools that I use in my day-to-day activities. The scripts are organized into subfolders, each dedicated to a specific category of automation tasks.

## Directory Structure

- **binary-tools/**: This folder contains tools related to binary number automation, including the tool I recently developed. It will also house various other binary-related tools in the future.
  - **.bin/**: This subfolder holds binary files necessary for all scripts designed for the Linux x64 architecture.

## Purpose

The scripts in this directory are designed to streamline processes, enhance productivity, and automate repetitive tasks across various domains. Whether you're working with binary numbers or other automation needs, you'll find tools here to help simplify your workflow.

## Contribution

Feel free to explore the tools and modify them to suit your needs. Contributions and suggestions for new tools are always welcome!

## Usage

Each tool may have its specific usage instructions, which you can typically find within the respective folders. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to reach out.

Happy scripting!
